# run_analysis
## Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Assignment for Coursera course 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

### Assignment Details
The R script run_analysis.R has been created as per the project instructions: 
 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Output

The run_analysis.R script produces one out file: tidy.txt
Warnings displayed, if any, during execution of the script can be ignored.

### Documentation

The Code Book for this project is included in the file CodeBook.md
